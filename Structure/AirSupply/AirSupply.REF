Each tank has a valve that is set to the target
percent in the gas mixture. But the valves interact,
so we then calculate the exact percent.

The species are

  O2 (21%)
  N2 (79%)
  CO2 (0%)
  CO (0%)
  AnestheticGas (0%)

CO is specified in PPM.

To add CO2, CO or AnestheticGas, turn on the gas tanks.
