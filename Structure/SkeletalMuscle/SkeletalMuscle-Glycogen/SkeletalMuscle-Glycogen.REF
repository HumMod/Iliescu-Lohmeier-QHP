The factors that control glycogen synthesis are insulin, blood glucose and
the size of the glycogen pool. While fasting, formation rate is 20 mG/Min
for skeletal muscle. Synthesis rate can increase to 2000 mG/Min when all of
the above factors favor synthesis.

Note that units for glycogen mass are G while rates are mG/Min.
