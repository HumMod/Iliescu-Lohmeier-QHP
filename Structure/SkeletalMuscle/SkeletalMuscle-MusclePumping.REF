Skeletal muscle contractions pump blood through the muscle,
which is represented as a increase in vascular conductance.

Sheriff, Rowell and Scher. AJP 265:H1227-H1234, 1993.

We'll use both intesity (motion watts) and contraction rate
to determine the pumping effect.

  Effect = 1.0 + f(Watts) * f(Rate)

Minimum effect is 1.0 at rest. Maximum effect is 2.0 at
maximum exertion.
