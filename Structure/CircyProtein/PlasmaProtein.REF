This model assumes that plasma protein (ie. albumin) is
synthesized and catabolized in the liver and is exchanged
with the plasma in the liver sinuses.

GAIN
  Synthesis
  Systemic Lymph
  Transfusion
  Peritoneal Lymph
  IV Drip

LOSS
  Catabolism
  Capillary Leak
  Hemorrhage
  Hepatic Effusion
  Kidney

Guyton says that whole-body protein turnover is 400 G/Day
and about 3% is plasma protein.

Plasma protein turnover would be 12 G/Day or about 0.01 G/Min.

I'll put 210 G in the plasma.
